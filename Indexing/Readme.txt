Additional library used: opencsv for parsing csv files.

1. The Java code prompts the user to choose the field, then obtains the required operation and then prompts the user to enter the value on which the data needs to be filtered. In the case of boolean and string attributes, the program forces the operation to comparison.


2. Also note that while querying for a boolean field, the values must be entered either as "true" or "false" by the user.

3. The name of the csv file should be PHARMA_TRIALS_1000B.csv. Please make sure that it is available in the same path as the path where the main class is present.

4. To execute the class please change directory to Indexing/build/classes and execute the following command in terminal/command prompt 
 
	abinav@BIGDEN:~/NetBeansProjects/Indexing/build/classes$ java MyDatabase
